##To test with a string
1. Put in text into the first box
2. Put in the RegEx into the RegEx box, press enter

##To test with a URL
1. Put the URL into the second box, press enter.
If the program was able to receive the HTML, it will display the length of the HTML in the first text box
If there was an error, the first text box will show "Error"
2. Put in the RegEx into the RegEx box, press enter

Please note that this program does NOT show multiple match results
(but that can be easily added at a later date, if you happen to create that before I do, please create a pull request, thanks!)
